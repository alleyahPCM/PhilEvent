# PhilEvent
Introducing PhilEvent, a dedicated event aggregation platform designed to address the absence of a centralized hub for event information in the Philippines. The current fragmented landscape makes it challenging for both enthusiasts and organizers to access comprehensive details about upcoming activities. PhilEvent bridges this gap by employing web scraping techniques to gather information from various sources, consolidating it into a single, accessible database. Developed using ReactJS, a dynamic and responsive JavaScript toolkit, the platform ensures a consistent user experience with interactive elements for enhanced engagement. Real-time updates through web scraping technology keep PhilEvent current, providing users with the latest information on diverse events across the country. Join us in creating a vibrant and connected event community, where you can explore, stay informed, and make the most of your event experiences.
